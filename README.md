# Razor Pages Project

Going through the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0) to create a razor pages project

### Branching Strategy
I am following [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) Workflow, so using Main for the "production" and Develop for the features of the application.

### How to run the project
This is a .NET 5 project with ASP.NET Core 5.

Main branch holds the releases of the project, or have a look through develop for the various steps I've taken to build the application.

Pull the branch, ( make sure you have the .NET 5 runtime ), Restore, and hit Launch.
